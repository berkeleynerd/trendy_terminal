-- Trendy Terminal defines a known environment in which to perform input/output.
-- Failure to meet these requirements results in an failed initialization.

-- The requirements:
-- 1. UTF-8
-- 2. VT100 terminal escape sequences.
--
-- The base package provides platform-specific environment setup, and the basic
-- read/write commands on top of which to build functionality.
